## Hello, dear developers 👋

Welcome to use Lanying IM SDK and build your next-gen chat AI apps.

Lanying IM, developed by [MaximTop](https://www.lanyingim.com/) team, is next-gen chat AI cloud. Benefits from cloud-native technologies and multi-cloud architecture, the private cloud is charged monthly as well as the public cloud.

Currently, among every seven newly shipped smartphones worldwide, one is using Lanying IM technology.

In addition to the chat SDK, Lanying IM also has integrated LLM AI services. Enterprises can directly access multiple AI models such as OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft ChatGPT, and Baidu Wenxin Yiyuan in the console backend.  

We have recently released two major AI products, please feel free to try:  

1. LinkChat, a short link that allows you to chat directly with AI;
2. Enterprise knowledge base aka BlueVector, which supports uploading knowledge documents to customize enterprise AI assistants.

👩‍💻 All documents are also published on our official website [docs.lanyingim.com](https://docs.lanyingim.com).
