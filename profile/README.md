## Helloo, dear developers 👋

Welcome to choose Lanying IM, and add chat functions to your applications.

Lanying IM, developed by [MaximTop](https://www.lanyingim.com/) team, is a new generation IM cloud service. Benefits from cloud-native technologies and multi-cloud architecture, the private cloud is charged monthly as well as the public cloud.

The SDK is designed in a minimalist approach and thus easy to integrate. With the accumulation of instant messaging IM technology for 10+ years, Lanying IM SDK and service API have been optimized to provide more professional services through simpler interfaces.

One-click enable multi-cloud architecture, which is the unique advantage of Lanying IM Cloud Service.

One-click enable means from basic functions to service customization, all can be opened and used with one-click operation on the console; Multi-cloud architecture supports free migration of applications in different deployment modes of Public Cloud, Proprietary Cloud and Private Cloud, conforming to the business development stages, and implementing worry-free, seamless platform migration and switching.

With the omnipotent console, there are only two things you need to do, one is to integrate Lanying IM SDK on the client side, and the other is to connect Lanying API service on the server side. This paper mainly introduces the work related to client SDK integration.

Lanying IM SDK is cross-platform, including mobile (iOS/Android), PC desktop (Linux/Windows/Mac), Web browser (including H5) and WeChat applet.
